## Hi! 👋
I'm Mustafa, a R&D Software Engineer at ANSYS!

- 🚀 **I develop software for ANSYS Inc.'s flagship Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) product, ANSYS Fluent**. 
- 📚 **Things I specialize in**: Software development for CFD and other scientific programming applications. Started from the math and now we're here!
- 🔭 **Things I'm good at**: High Performance Computing (HPC) - OpenMP, MPI and CUDA programming. I started my internal monologue on computer architecture and operating systems during my initial days of HPC, and I haven't shut up since!
- 🌱 **Things I'm getting better at**: Full stack development focused on making portable and lightweight applications. Boy, this needs work...

## 🧑‍💻: Languages

- C++
- Python
- JavaScript


I have been working on numerical mathematics problems for a good part of the last decade, where writing and shipping software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems occupies a major portion of my time.

I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading. When I'm not tinkering with any new technology I can code with, I'm usually reading about medicine and history.
