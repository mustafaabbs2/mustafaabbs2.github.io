## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mustafa, a R&D Software Engineer at ANSYS!

- ðŸš€ **I develop software for ANSYS Inc.'s flagship Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) product, ANSYS Fluent**. 
- ðŸ“š **Things I specialize in**: Software development for CFD and other scientific programming applications. Started from the math and now we're here!
- ðŸ”­ **Things I'm good at**: High Performance Computing (HPC) - OpenMP, MPI and CUDA programming. I started my internal monologue on computer architecture and operating systems during my initial days of HPC, and I haven't shut up since!
- ðŸŒ± **Things I'm getting better at**: Full stack development focused on making portable and lightweight applications. Boy, this needs work...

I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading. When I'm not tinkering with any new technology I can code with, I'm usually reading about medicine and history.
