I'm Mustafa, a R&D Software Engineer at ANSYS!

At work, I develop software for ANSYS's (now Synopsys) flagship Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) product, ANSYS Fluent. My work primarily focuses on building robust, scalable, and efficient software solutions for scientific and engineering applications. I previously completed a MSc. in Computational Science from the RWTH Aachen. 

In general, I specialize in software development for CFD and other scientific programming domains, with a strong foundation in High Performance Computing (HPC). My experience spans parallel programming with OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA, and I maintain a deep interest in computer architecture and operating systems that grew from my early days in HPC.

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, reading, and quizzing. 
I play counterpunching tennis, read books on history and medicine, and quiz terribly. I currently reside in Pune, India with my wife.
